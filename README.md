# InvarianceHypothesis

This project contains several tools for analyzing trade and quote datasets from the Thomson Reuters Tick History (TRTH) as used in my master thesis with the title "Marktmikrostruktur-Invarianz: Eine empirische Analyse europäischer Aktien".

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. To use all functionalities you have to get likewise structured data compared to those descriped in my thesis.

### Prerequisites

All required packages are listed in the requirements.txt file. This project is developed and tested with Python version 3.6 only. The specific versions of used packages you can find in the requirements text file as well. The best way is to set up a new virtual environment with Anaconda, then start a command prompt in the location of the environment you've just created and execute the following snippet:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Of course you can install the packages listed in the .txt file manually via the Anaconda GUI or via the environment configuration menu of your preferred IDE.

## Running the program

The main entry point is the file program.py. If you configure your interpreter to execute this file you are given an instance of the preprocessor class by default. Out of this class you have access to all functionalities implemented in this project.

### Modules

Apart from the initialization of the program in program.py, all functions and methods are outsourced in further modules:

* preprocessing (in the folder ./Common) containing all "spanning" functions that are implemented with standard python basically
* pandashelper (in the folder ./Util) containing all direct data operations, implemented with specific data science functions from pandas mainly and numpy in part

These modules will be imported from the program.py already of course. You can access it's functions from the main program level via
```
preprocessing.your_function_call()
preprocessing.pandashelper.your_function_call()
```
or import the modules manually wherever you are with
```
import Common.preprocessing
import Util.pandashelper
```

## Built With
