# InvarianceHypothesis

This project contains several tools for analyzing trade and quote datasets downloaded from Thomson Reuters as used in my master thesis with the title 'Marktmikrostruktur-Invarianz: Eine empirische Analyse europ√§ischer Aktien'.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

All required packages are listed in the requirements.txt file. This project is developed and tested with Python version 3.6 only. The specific versions of used packages you can find in the requirements text file as well. The best way is to set up a new virtual environment with Anaconda, then start a command prompt in the location of the environment you've just created and execute the following snippet:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Of course you can install the packages listed in the .txt file manually via the Anaconda GUI or via the environment configuration menu of your preferred IDE.

## Running the program

The main entry point is the file program.py. If you configure your interpreter to execute this file you are given an instance of the preprocessor class. Out of this class you have access to all functionalities implemented in this project.

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
